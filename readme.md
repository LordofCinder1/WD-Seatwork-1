## Overview

This project is a scrollable single-page website showcasing five custom header designs and five animated footer designs for a fictional VPN brand called "brandname." The purpose of this activity is to demonstrate web layout skills, animation effects, and styling using HTML and CSS. The overall design is inspired by Canva and follows a professional, clean theme using dark blue and white tones. The headers feature variations of logos, navigation links, and call-to-action buttons, while the footers incorporate different hover animations such as slide-up, slide-in, and zoom effects. This exercise highlights front-end development proficiency and creative interface design for modern web applications.
