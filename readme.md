## 📄 Overview

This project consists of two themed HTML pages:

- One page features **five unique header designs**
- Another page includes **five creative footer designs**

All are tailored for a fictional VPN brand. The site was created as part of a front-end web development exercise using HTML and CSS. It demonstrates animation effects, responsive layouting, and consistent styling under a themed design inspired by minimalist UI trends (dark mode, glow/flicker animations, falling leaves, etc.).

## ✅ Rules, Practices & Principles

1. Project name follows the `WD-` prefix format: `WD-Seatwork-1`
2. All pages use **external CSS** (no inline styles unless necessary)
3. File names follow **camelCase** (e.g., `headerBlock.html`, `footerGrid.css`)
4. Clear and organized structure:
```
    assets
  css
    style.css
  img       
  js  
pages
    footers
    headers
index.html
LICENSE
readme.md
```
5. Visual consistency is achieved through:
   - Stick font for all headings
   - Themed animations (falling leaves, flicker glow)
   - Color palette: black background, gold/yellow accent (#ffcc00), white text
